At the current moment one of the things I'm doing with that SkyCoord is choosing a bunch of random detections from it and extracting spectra from them using get_spectra().

    "Since spectrum extraction returns an astropy table, my first thought was to make a list of astropy tables and either make a large astropy table or a dataframe. I opted with the dataframe since it has more functionality to remove duplicates and filter things. However the extraction tables have some parts which are multidimensional, and .to_pandas doesn't allow for that. So now my plan is to use the same logic I used to store the actual spectrum numbers/values to store the shotid of everything. Then the shotids and exctraction value's indeces should match. I can then just check if I have any repeating shotid's. If the shot id's match anywhere, then we remove those shot id's at their indeces and remove the spectra values at those indeces as well."
