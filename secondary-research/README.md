# Secondary Research

This folder is going to contain all the papers/courses/etc I have/will read to help me complete the project. It will also includes general notes and useful resources I find throughout my project. I won't put every single thing I have read/skimmed here, but only things I would like to maybe revisit someday.

## General notes

<details><summary>Fall 2022</summary>

 I started off the semester with a really broad plan to automate the classification of LAEs. Since I couldn't just automate everything at once, I focused on a way to first classify the spectra. The ultimate goal is to finish classifying spectra and move to something else, but as of right now (Dec 1, 2022) I will only focus on spectra.
 
 In our subgroup meetings it was decided that I would first focus on training a ML algorithm to differentiate between High-Z spectra and noise spectra. To do this I spent time writing code to make me a noise sample. After that, I spent time making a sample of random sources in order to run them through an autoencoder and then t-SNE and finally Gaussian mixture (code for these was adapted from Valentina's old work). After that I wrote some code to give me a "high quality" sample of high-z spectra. My goal now is to train a Random Forest ML algorithm to differentiate between high-z spectra and noise.
